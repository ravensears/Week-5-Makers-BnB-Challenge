Development workflow
- Create a Github issue in the relevant repository relating to the user story or bug.

****documentation about github issues: https://docs.github.com/en/issues

- When you are ready to work on the user story, create a branch for it, e.g. dates-on-apply-page.

- Pair on implementing the user story.

- When you are done, create a pull request from your branch to main.

- Get another member of the team to review your PR.

- Use the pull request comments section to discuss the code and make improvements until the code reviewing pair are satisfied.

- When you get a thumbs up or other similarly appropriate emoji, merge your PR.

- When you're happy, merge your changes on GitHub. You should then deploy immediately. If you have CI setup you can get it to do this for you automatically.

- Do some QA on your live site if you have it set up.

- High-five someone/something.
